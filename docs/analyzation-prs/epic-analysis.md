# Simple Epic Overview (Author: MehmetVolkan)

Purpose: lightweight list to discuss scope; only note (a) what is or should be handled in PayloadCMS vs (b) UI work present / missing. No deep analysis.

## Research Methodology for Linking PRs to Epics
For each epic below we identify the Pull Requests (PRs) that contributed materially to its backend or UI implementation using these steps:
1. Enumerate all PRs merged into `main` (historic + recent) via the repository PR list.
2. Scan commit messages for domain keywords (e.g., "clinic", "treatment", "review", "auth", "permission", "seed", "block") and issue-style verbs (feat/fix/chore) to shortlist candidates.
3. Cross-reference shortlisted PRs with collection / hook responsibilities (e.g., pricing -> `clinicTreatments`, reviews -> `reviews` collection, admin ergonomics -> form/layout refactors).
4. Attribute each epic only to PRs that either:
	- Added or modified schema / hooks powering that capability, or
	- Added seeding / baseline content essential for UI, or
	- Adjusted access control / permission layers required for the feature to function, or
	- Delivered UI building blocks (blocks/components) used directly by the epic.
5. Exclude pure dependency bumps / unrelated CI changes unless they directly unlocked a blocked type or build issue for the feature.

Each epic section now contains an "Implementation Trace" list (PR number, concise description, merge date, and rationale). Missing elements (gaps) are explicitly noted to highlight remaining work. Process batches are limited to 3 issues per update to keep context focused, per instruction.

### Dependency-Only and Closed-without-Merge PRs

- **Merged dependency maintenance** – #22, #23, #28, #29, #32, #34, #35, #37, #41, #103, #115, #117, #124, #125, #171, #172, #178, #181, #182, #183, #187, #193, #194, #196, #198, #203, #210, #211, #215, #224, #225, #228, #230, #241, #250, #251, #256, #257, #258, #267, #269, #270, #271, #279, #280, #284, #293, #294, #317, #323, #325, #326, #332, #333. These PRs strictly adjust dependencies or runtime images and therefore do not map to specific feature epics.
- **Closed without merge (no repository impact)** – #9, #24, #25, #26, #27, #30, #36, #38, #58, #98, #99, #100, #101, #102, #110, #111, #112, #113, #114, #116, #123, #169, #170, #179, #180, #188, #189, #190, #192, #197, #201, #202, #204, #205, #209, #212, #214, #216, #217, #221, #222, #223, #229, #231, #232, #237, #240, #242, #248, #253, #254, #263, #268, #278, #295, #296, #306, #307, #308, #309, #311, #318, #319, #338. These include early experiments (e.g., #9) that were superseded by merged pipeline work such as #31 and #126.

## Immediate Backlog Suggestions
- Unblock clinic registration (fix form bug #272) before deeper clinic/treatment UI work.
- Finalize media architecture (#264) before starting gallery (161) and richer articles imagery (163).
- Bundle search & comparison (154,155,158,159) into a single "Discovery" sprint to avoid fragmented query layer work.
- Address email verification (220) to complete auth epic (146) and reduce onboarding friction.

## Proposed Next Minimal Actions
1. Confirm which epics are MVP-critical: likely 146–149, 150, 156, 147.
2. For each: create one sentence vertical slice target (e.g., "Display approved reviews under clinic profile").
3. Add missing indexes for high-frequency filters (price, rating, city) where not yet present.
4. Draft a unified search endpoint spec supporting: treatmentId, cityId, sort (price|rating), priceRange.
5. Decide on gallery storage (reuse future `clinicMedia` collection) before schema changes.

## Open Clarifications (Keep Lightweight)
- Is a separate collection needed for "tips" or can it be a tagged article? (165)
- Do we aggregate ratings now or defer until after base review display? (150/157)
- Single endpoint vs multiple for comparison, auto-list, filtering? (154–159)

Edit this table collaboratively; keep statuses coarse. When ready for deeper dive, create per-epic docs.

## 146 – Registration and Login (CLOSED – Done)
Backend present: Supabase auth scaffold; email verification not finalized; social providers (Google/Facebook) not evident.
UI present: Basic login/register likely; forgot password + social buttons unclear.
Minimal Next Slice (post-closure follow-ups): Implement email verification link flow + surface resend link; social sign-in as enhancement.
Clarification Questions:
1. Are Google and Facebook mandatory for MVP or optional enhancement?
2. Do we require enforced email verification before any protected action (favorites, reviews)?
3. Should password strength rules exceed "minimum length" (e.g., complexity, breach check)?

Implementation Trace (PRs verified in `docs/pr-change-log.md`):
- #195 Multi-user auth architecture (patients, clinic staff, platform) – auth collections, strategies, access utilities, and pages; core backend for Supabase ↔ Payload flows.
- #52 Admin (Staff) Collection & Supabase Auth Consolidation – initial Supabase auth consolidation and strategy wiring.
- #90 Rename staff → platformStaff; auth wiring – aligns staff identity model and auth flows across admin/auth surfaces.
- #38 Authentication Forms (Login & Registration UI) – implements base login/register UI components.
- #40 Clinics on Home + Login Integration – integrates auth UI with app shell.
- #93 Adapt posts/pages/media; minor auth tweaks – ancillary adjustments that touched auth utilities (minor).

Additional Closed PRs (API audit):
- #249 Improve Supabase authentication error logging – strengthens observability for failed login/registration attempts.
- #312 Allow user management with Supabase auth from Payload admin UI only – ensures account provisioning remains aligned with Supabase strategy used by this epic.
- #327 Reworked permission documentation and moved fields to basic users – clarifies auth data stored on login-capable users and documents enforced permission rules.

Notes: Closed as done for MVP auth path; Google/Facebook social providers and final email verification (#220) remain tracked as follow-ups.

## 147 – Clinic Registration with Admin Approval
Backend present: `clinics` with status field; approval workflow partial. Form bug (#272) blocks creation.
UI present: Registration form exists but broken; admin approval UI present in Payload default list.
Minimal Next Slice: Fix form fetch (slug query) + show post-submit pending state.
Clarification Questions:
1. Should rejection reason be stored/displayed to clinic applicant?
2. Do we auto-email on approval/rejection now or defer?
3. Is there a max pending submission retry or rate limit needed (spam prevention)?

## 148 – Clinic Profiles with Name, Location, Description
Backend present: Fields exist (address, maybe geo point). Need confirmation geo coordinates stored.
UI present: Basic profile page; map & rich formatting maybe missing.
Minimal Next Slice: Add map component using stored coordinates; fallback geocode if missing.
Clarification Questions:
1. Are we storing lat/long explicitly or deriving via geocoding API on save?
2. Is map provider fixed (Google) or can we use open source (Leaflet/OSM) to avoid API key overhead now?
3. Should description support rich text (headings, links) or remain plain for MVP?

## 149 – Treatment Offerings & Price Information
Backend present: `treatments` / `clinicTreatments` join; confirm price fields (range vs single). Indexing might be partial.
UI present: No pricing list rendering yet.
Minimal Next Slice: Show list of clinic treatments with "from €X" using lowest price field.
Clarification Questions:
1. Do we need price ranges (min/max) or just a single "from" price for MVP?
2. Currency fixed to EUR now or multi-currency needed?
3. Should treatments be ordered manually, alphabetically, or by price by default?

Gaps: No PR explicitly titled for mobile/responsive audit; lack of documented passes for mobile-specific navigation or layout fixes. Need targeted QA + follow-up PRs.

## 154 – Direct Comparison by Treatment Type
Backend present: Relationship query possible; may need efficient index on clinicTreatments.treatment.
UI present: None (comparison view missing).
Minimal Next Slice: Endpoint returning clinics for a selected treatment (name, price, rating snapshot).
Clarification Questions:
1. Do we need side-by-side comparison columns (features) or just a filtered list?
2. Are unavailable prices hidden or shown as "—"?
3. Should results auto-sort by price or rating by default here (conflict with 158)?

Implementation Trace (PRs verified in `docs/pr-change-log.md`):
- #166 ClinicTreatments join (clinic ↔ treatment w/ price) – provides the core relationship needed to query clinics by treatment.
- #176 Reviews + Medical Specialties revamp – rating aggregation complementary for comparison views.

Additional Closed PRs (API audit):
- #227 Calculation hooks for ratings and prices – ensures comparison queries read the latest aggregates.
- #299 Baseline/demo seeding architecture – seeds demo data for comparison scenarios.

Gaps: No PR adds a comparison endpoint or UI/table; no indexing PR explicitly optimizing treatment-based queries (verify need for index on `clinictreatments.treatment`).

## 155 – Automatic Display After Treatment Selection
Backend present: Same query logic as 154.
UI present: Missing auto-navigation or dynamic route.
Minimal Next Slice: After selecting treatment in search, redirect to comparison list with query param.
Clarification Questions:
1. Should selection persist in URL (e.g., /clinics?tx=<id>) for sharable links?
2. Do we prefetch clinic data on selection for faster transition?
3. Keyboard accessibility for selection required now?

Implementation Trace (PRs verified in `docs/pr-change-log.md`):
- #166 ClinicTreatments join – backend relation enabling the query upon selection.
- #176 Reviews + Medical Specialties revamp – rating data available post-selection.
- #88 Rename Treatments → Medical Specialties – ensures consistent naming used in selection and routing.

Additional Closed PRs (API audit):
- #227 Calculation hooks for ratings and prices – keeps selection-triggered aggregates current.
- #299 Baseline/demo seeding architecture – seeds treatment data for end-to-end selection demos.

Gaps: No PR establishing an auto-redirect flow or dedicated search selection component; no route-level handling of treatment query param for immediate list rendering.

Backend present: Need deterministic query params & indexes (price, rating).
UI present: Sorting controls absent.
Minimal Next Slice: Add sort dropdown (price asc/desc, rating desc, best deals placeholder).
Clarification Questions:
1. Definition of "Best Deals" beyond rating ≥ 4 (tie-breaker)?
2. Should sort preference persist (localStorage) between sessions?
3. Do we expose number of clinics excluded by "Best Deals" filter?

Implementation Trace (PRs verified in `docs/pr-change-log.md`):

Gaps: No PR implements explicit sort query params on an endpoint or UI sort controls; need endpoint spec (e.g., /api/clinics?sort=rating_desc) + indexes confirmation (price/rating fields). No caching strategy defined for heavy sort queries.

## 159 – Sorting & Filtering Functions
Backend present: Fields exist (price, rating, location); duration flag maybe missing.
UI present: No multi-filter UI yet.
Minimal Next Slice: Implement location + price range filters; defer duration if not modeled.
Clarification Questions:
1. Are price ranges static constants or dynamic buckets computed from data?
2. Is multi-select location allowed or single city only for MVP?

## 160 – Doctor Profiles with Qualifications
Backend present: `doctors` collection; qualifications likely textual/array.
UI present: Not rendering dedicated doctor section on clinic page yet.
Minimal Next Slice: Add doctor list component with qualifications snippet.
Clarification Questions:
1. Are qualifications structured (array) or free text only?
2. Do we need doctor detail pages, or only inline cards in clinic profile?

If UI truly exists, link PR; if not, adjust readiness score or add PR once implemented. No PR cited adding doctor profile UI (cards/components). Potential adjustment required.

## 161 – Before-and-After Picture Gallery
Backend present: Awaiting media collection strategy (#264); no pairing model defined.
UI present: None.
Minimal Next Slice: Decide schema for paired images (single collection with before/after fields) then simple slider component.
Clarification Questions:
1. Pairing model: two upload fields in a single doc vs separate docs linked by pairId?
2. Do we need explicit patient consent tracking now?
3. Are image transformations (cropping) handled client-side or deferred?

Implementation Trace (PRs verified in `docs/pr-change-log.md`):
- #57 Supabase Storage Integration – foundational media storage.
- #186 Fix S3 storage: type/schema mismatch + migration – stabilizes external storage config/migration.
