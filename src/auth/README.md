# Authentication System

A modular authentication system integrating Supabase Auth with PayloadCMS, designed for multi-tenant healthcare platform management.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The authentication system follows a **utility-based architecture** that separates concerns into focused, testable modules:

```
src/auth/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Configuration and constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategies/       # PayloadCMS authentication strategies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # Shared TypeScript interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utilities/       # Core authentication logic
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jwtValidation    # Token & user validation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userLookup       # User search operations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userCreation     # User creation logic
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ accessValidation # Permission checking
```

### **Key Design Principles**

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each utility handles one specific aspect of authentication
2. **Testability**: 100% unit test coverage with comprehensive mocking
3. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript interfaces prevent runtime errors
4. **Modularity**: Easy to extend, modify, or replace individual components
5. **Configuration-Driven**: Centralized config supports multiple user types

## üöÄ Authentication Concepts

### User Types & Access Patterns

The system supports three user types with different access patterns:

| User Type | Collection | Profile Collection | Admin Access | API Access | Approval Required |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Clinic Staff** | `basicUsers` | `clinicStaff` | ‚úÖ (if approved) | ‚úÖ | Yes |
| **Platform Staff** | `basicUsers` | `platformStaff` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | No |
| **Patients** | `patients` | None | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (own data) | No |

### Authentication Flow Stages

1. **Token Validation**: Extract and verify JWT from authorization headers
2. **User Data Extraction**: Parse user metadata from Supabase session
3. **User Resolution**: Find existing user or create new user with profile
4. **Access Authorization**: Validate permissions based on user type and approval status
5. **Session Establishment**: Return authenticated user for PayloadCMS

### Profile Management Strategy

- **Staff Users**: Automatically create both user record and corresponding profile
- **Atomic Operations**: User + profile creation happens in single transaction
- **Profile Recovery**: Missing profiles are automatically created during login
- **Approval Workflow**: Clinic staff require explicit approval for admin access

## üîß Configuration Concepts

### Environment Requirements

The system requires three Supabase environment variables for JWT validation and API communication.

### User Type Configuration

Each user type has specific configuration defining:
- Target collection for user records
- Profile collection (if applicable)
- Whether profile creation is required
- Whether approval is needed for access

### Access Control Strategy

- **Collection-Level**: Broad access defined in PayloadCMS collection configurations
- **Field-Level**: Granular field access based on user roles
- **Admin Interface**: Restricted to approved staff users only
- **API Access**: All authenticated users can access APIs with appropriate scope

## üìä Business Logic

### User Creation Workflow

**New Staff Users**:
1. Create user record in `basicUsers` collection
2. Simultaneously create profile in appropriate staff collection
3. Both operations succeed together or fail together (atomic)

**New Patients**:
1. Create user record directly in `patients` collection
2. No additional profile creation needed

### Approval Process

**Clinic Staff Approval**:
- New clinic users created but marked as unapproved
- Platform administrators manually approve clinic staff
- Unapproved users cannot access admin interface
- API access remains available regardless of approval status

**Platform Staff**:
- Automatically approved upon creation
- Immediate access to all platform features

### Session Management

- **Token Lifecycle**: JWT tokens validated on each request
- **User Resolution**: Supabase ID used as permanent user identifier
- **Profile Consistency**: Missing profiles automatically restored
- **Access Validation**: Real-time permission checking

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Philosophy

- **Unit Testing**: Each utility module independently tested
- **Mock Strategy**: External dependencies (Supabase, PayloadCMS) fully mocked
- **Error Scenarios**: All failure modes and edge cases covered
- **Type Validation**: Interface contracts verified through tests

### Test Organization

The test suite covers four main areas:
- **JWT Processing**: Token extraction and validation logic
- **User Operations**: Lookup, creation, and profile management
- **Access Control**: Permission validation and approval workflows
- **Configuration**: User type mapping and environment validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Adding New User Types

1. **Update Configuration**: Define collection mappings and requirements
2. **Update Type Definitions**: Extend interfaces to include new user type
3. **Create Tests**: Verify new user type behavior
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect new user type in business logic

### Debugging Strategy

- **Development Logging**: Enhanced logging in development environment
- **Error Classification**: Structured error handling with appropriate log levels
- **Performance Tracking**: Authentication timing and success metrics
- **Security Monitoring**: Failed authentication attempts and suspicious activity

## üîê Security Principles

### Token Security

- **JWT Verification**: All tokens validated against Supabase secret
- **Expiration Handling**: Expired tokens automatically rejected
- **Header Validation**: Secure Bearer token format required

### Access Boundaries

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum necessary access
- **Role Separation**: Clear boundaries between clinic, platform, and patient access
- **Approval Gates**: Additional authorization layer for sensitive roles

### Error Handling Philosophy

- **Graceful Degradation**: Authentication failures result in access denial, not system errors
- **Information Hiding**: Error messages reveal minimal information to unauthorized users
- **Audit Trail**: All authentication events logged for security monitoring

## üìà Operational Considerations

### Monitoring Metrics

- Authentication success and failure rates by user type
- User creation patterns and approval workflow efficiency
- System performance during authentication operations
- Error frequency and categorization

### Scalability Design

- **Stateless Authentication**: No server-side session storage required
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimized queries for user lookup operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Configuration and user data caching opportunities
- **Load Distribution**: Authentication workload distributed across utilities

## üîÑ Migration Considerations

### Architecture Evolution

The current modular design replaces a previous monolithic approach, providing:
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual authentication aspects
- **Testability**: Comprehensive testing of isolated components
- **Extensibility**: Simple addition of new user types and workflows
- **Reliability**: Reduced complexity and improved error handling

### Integration Points

- **PayloadCMS Integration**: Seamless integration with collection access controls
- **Supabase Integration**: Leverages Supabase Auth without vendor lock-in
- **Frontend Compatibility**: Works with any client capable of JWT authentication
- **API Consistency**: Uniform authentication across all API endpoints
