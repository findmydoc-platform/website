/**
 * Custom SCSS for the Payload Admin Panel.
 *
 * ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:
 * Do NOT import Tailwind CSS here (e.g., `@import "tailwindcss";`).
 * Doing so will leak Tailwind's reset and base styles into the Admin Panel,
 * breaking its layout and styling.
 *
 * If you need to use Tailwind classes within a custom Admin component,
 * ensure they are strictly scoped or use a separate CSS module.
