# Assets & media

Stories must be deterministic and work offline. Use local assets and shared fixtures.

## Asset policy

- Do not hotlink images or videos from external URLs.
- Prefer local assets stored alongside stories (for example, an `assets` folder under `src/stories`).
- Placeholders may be committed as PNGs following the `placeholder-<width>-<height>.png` naming pattern.

These rules are enforced by repository-wide Storybook guidance.

## Shared fixtures

Use story fixtures to keep data consistent and reusable:

```ts
export const listingFixture = {
  id: 'listing-01',
  name: 'Atlas Medical Center',
  city: 'Lisbon',
  rating: 4.7,
}
```

## Examples

```tsx
import hero from './assets/hero.jpg'

const meta = {
  title: 'Organisms/Hero',
  parameters: { layout: 'fullscreen' },
}

export const Default = {
  args: {
    image: hero,
    heading: 'Care abroad, made simple',
  },
}
```

## Tip

If you need a new asset, download it and commit it locally, then reference it by import to keep Storybook offline-friendly.
