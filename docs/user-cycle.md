# Implementation Plan: Align User Management with System Diagram

## Executive Summary

This plan restructures the user management system to follow the diagram as single source of truth, eliminating the current dual-flow problem and consolidating all user creation logic into PayloadCMS collection hooks.

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current Problematic Dual Flow
```
Registration Form ‚Üí API ‚Üí Supabase User ‚Üí Payload Records
Admin UI Form ‚Üí Collection ‚Üí Hook ‚Üí BasicUser + Profile
```

### Target Diagram Flow
```
Forms ‚Üí Collections ‚Üí Collection Hooks ‚Üí Supabase User Creation + Profile Creation
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: BasicUsers + PlatformStaff Foundation üéØ

**Goal**: Establish the new pattern with the simplest user type (platform staff)

#### 1.1 Update BasicUsers Collection Configuration
- [] **Update access controls** in `src/collections/BasicUsers.ts`

  - [x] Store `supabaseUserId` back to BasicUser record
  - [x] Handle errors gracefully (rollback on failure)
  - [x] Add logging for debugging
- [x] **Create deletion hook** in `src/hooks/userLifecycle/basicUserDeletionHook.ts`
  - [x] Add `beforeDelete` hook that removes related Supabase user

### Phase 3: ClinicStaff Dual Flow üè•

**Goal**: Implement two distinct flows for clinic staff management

#### Phase 3A: Admin UI ClinicStaff Flow (Hook-based, Automated)

**Goal**: Enable automated hook-based creation for trusted admin operations

#### 3A.1 ClinicStaff Collection Analysis
- [ ] **Analyze current ClinicStaff hooks** in `src/collections/ClinicStaff.ts`
  - [ ] Document current hook behavior
  - [ ] Identify which hooks should stay (for BasicUser creation)
  - [ ] Plan hook enhancement/modification

#### 3A.2 Enhance ClinicStaff Collection Hooks

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Consolidation üßπ

**Goal**: Remove redundant code and ensure system consistency

#### 4.1 Remove Redundant Registration APIs
- [x] **Analyze registration utilities** in `src/auth/utilities/registration.ts`
  - [x] Identified unused clinic helper; safe to remove now
  - [x] Added deprecation note to patient helper pending Phase 2
  - [x] Plan: remove patient helper and base handler after Phase 2

#### 4.2 Clean Up Registration Utilities
- [x] **Remove unused functions** from `src/auth/utilities/`
  - [x] Remove `createPatientRecord` function (deferred to Phase 2)
  - [x] Remove `createClinicStaffRecords` function
  - [x] Remove `baseRegistrationHandler` (deferred to Phase 2)
  - [x] Keep `createSupabaseUser` for hook usage

#### 4.3 Remove Redundant API Endpoints
- [x] **Remove/simplify registration endpoints**
  - [x] Simplify `src/app/api/auth/register/patient/route.ts` to create via Patients collection (hooks provision Supabase)
  - [x] Simplify `src/app/api/auth/register/first-admin/route.ts` (added Payload-side checks)
  - [x] Update deprecation notes for legacy endpoints

#### 4.4 Update Authentication Strategy
- [ ] **Review Supabase strategy** in `src/auth/strategies/supabaseStrategy.ts`
  - [ ] Ensure it works with new hook-based approach
  - [ ] Remove any redundant user creation logic
  - [ ] Update error handling if needed

#### 4.5 Remove Duplicate Hook System

  - [ ] This file contains the duplicate hook system we analyzed
  - [ ] Move any useful utilities to the main hooks
  - [ ] Update imports throughout codebase

#### 4.6 Update Access Controls
- [ ] **Review and update access controls** across all collections
  - [ ] Ensure forms can create records through collections
  - [ ] Verify admin UI still works correctly
  - [ ] Test authentication flows work

#### 4.7 Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Update authentication documentation** in `docs/authentication-system.md`
  - [ ] Reflect new single-flow approach
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams
  - [ ] Document hook system clearly
  - [x] Added BasicUsers single-flow details and marked patient registration as legacy

#### 4.8 Final Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Comprehensive integration testing**
  - [ ] Test all user creation flows (form, admin UI)
  - [ ] Verify authentication works for all user types
  - [ ] Test approval workflows
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and rollback behavior

#### 4.9 Code Quality and Performance
- [ ] **Run code quality checks**
  - [ ] Execute `pnpm check` for type checking and linting
  - [ ] Fix any type errors or linting issues
  - [ ] Update tests to match new architecture

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Transaction safety**: Ensure all hooks use proper transactions
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: Handle Supabase outages gracefully
- [ ] **Logging**: Add comprehensive logging for debugging with payload native logging
- [ ] **Error reporting**: Ensure errors are properly reported and monitored

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Platform staff can be created via BasicUsers collection
- [ ] Hooks automatically create Supabase users and PlatformStaff profiles
- [ ] First admin registration works with new flow
- [ ] **Deletion hooks properly cascade to PlatformStaff and Supabase**
- [ ] **Data integrity is maintained during deletion operations**
- [ ] All tests pass

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] Patient registration works through Patients collection
- [ ] Patient hooks create Supabase users correctly
- [ ] Patient authentication and access controls work
- [ ] All tests pass

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] **Phase 3A (Admin UI)**: ClinicStaff creation via admin UI triggers BasicUser creation automatically
- [ ] **Phase 3A (Admin UI)**: Hook-based flow creates Supabase users correctly for clinic staff
- [ ] **Phase 3A (Admin UI)**: Clinic staff authentication works properly after admin creation
- [ ] **Phase 3B (Public)**: Public clinic registration creates form submissions (not direct records)
- [ ] **Phase 3B (Public)**: Manual approval workflow is documented and tested
- [ ] **Phase 3B (Public)**: Form submission process works end-to-end
- [ ] All tests pass for both flows

### Phase 4 Complete When:
- [ ] No redundant code remains
- [ ] Single flow architecture is fully implemented
- [ ] Documentation is updated and accurate
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] All integration tests pass

## Timeline Estimation

- **Phase 1**: 3-4 days (foundation is critical)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (simpler implementation)
- **Phase 3**: 4-5 days (most complex due to approval workflow)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 days (cleanup and validation)

**Total**: 12-16 days

## Next Steps

1. **Get approval** for this implementation plan
2. **Set up testing environment** with current data
3. **Start with Phase 1** (BasicUsers + PlatformStaff)
4. **Review and test** each phase before proceeding
5. **Document progress** and lessons learned
