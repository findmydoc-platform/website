# UI & CMS boundary

The UI layer must stay Payload-free. Stories should model how presentational components are consumed, not how Payload structures its data.

## Rules

- Components in `src/components` must not accept Payload-shaped unions or relationship objects.
- Normalize Payload data in `src/blocks` or shared CMS adapters before it reaches UI.

These rules are defined in the CMS/UI boundary guidance.

## Examples

Normalized props in a UI story:
```tsx
export const Default = {
	args: {
		title: 'Clinic spotlight',
		summary: 'Modern care with multilingual support.',
		tags: ['cardiology', 'orthopedics'],
	},
}
```

CMS-aware content rendering (adapter-level):
```tsx
export const CmsAdapter = {
	args: {
		blocks: [
			{ type: 'paragraph', text: 'Adapter turns CMS data into UI props.' },
		],
	},
}
```

## Checklist

- UI stories pass normalized props only.
- If a story needs Payload data, it should live at the block/adapter layer.
- Keep examples aligned with existing access and hook boundaries.
