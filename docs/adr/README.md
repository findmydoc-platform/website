# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the findmydoc portal.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR documents a significant architectural decision along with its context and consequences. It helps team members understand why decisions were made and provides a historical record for future reference.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was documented
- **Context**: The problem or requirement driving the decision
- **Decision**: The chosen approach
- **Consequences**: Expected outcomes and trade-offs

## Index

| ID | Title | Status | Date |
|----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](./001-structured-logging-approach.md) | Structured Logging Approach | Proposed | 2025-12-11 |

## Creating a New ADR

1. Use the next sequential number (e.g., `002-title.md`)
2. Follow the template in existing ADRs
3. Include comprehensive context and comparison of alternatives
4. Update this README with a new entry in the index table
5. Link to the ADR from relevant documentation
